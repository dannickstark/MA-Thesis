\addsec*{Acknowledgements}

Since I started working on this thesis, I've been able to broaden my horizons and acquire extraordinary knowledge. It has been possible for me to work night and day on this thesis while maintaining a high level of dynamism, thanks to my enthusiasm for semantic technologies and intelligent systems. I have done my best to provide work that can be used in future research, as well as to provide a reliable, resilient, and usable solution.\\
On this occasion, I would like to thank Christian Malek, who helped to understand the specific aspects of my thesis as well as through the implementation and writing phases of this work. I would also like to thank Dr. Martin Becker and Jana Heinrich, who were a great help during our numerous meetings and workshops. Finally, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Peter Liggesmeyer for supervising my thesis.
